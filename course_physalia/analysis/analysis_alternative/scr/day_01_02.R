# 3. Downloading Example Dataset ------------------------------------------
# We'll work with data from the `spatialLIBD` package, which contains spatial transcriptomics data from human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This dataset provides an excellent example for learning spatial analysis techniques as it includes:
# - Multiple tissue sections
# - Known anatomical layers
# - Rich molecular information
# - High-quality imaging data

# libraries
library(SpatialExperiment)
library(ggspavis)
library(scuttle)
library(scater)
library(scran)
library(spatialLIBD)
library(ExperimentHub)

# In this section, we explore the handling and processing of spatial transcriptomics data using the `spatialLIBD` and `ExperimentHub` packages. The following R code block retrieves a specific dataset from the `ExperimentHub`, a Bioconductor project designed to manage and distribute large biological data sets. The code efficiently fetches the data, removes any existing dimensional reductions, and filters the dataset to include only selected samples. This approach is essential for analysing spatial patterns in gene expression across multiple samples, and the code below exemplifies how to manipulate these datasets in preparation for further analysis. This process is adapted from the `Banksy` package's vignette, which provides advanced methods for multi-sample spatial transcriptomics.

# 5. Quality control and filtering ----------------------------------------
# We will use the `scater` package [McCarthy et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/8/1179/2907823?login=true) to compute the three primary QC metrics we discussed earlWe'llUsing the scater Package for QC Metrics: We'll apply the `scater` package to compute three primary quality control metrics. We'll also use `ggspavis` for visualisation along with some custom plotting techniques.

### 6. Dimensionality reduction
# Dimensionality reduction is essential in spatial transcriptomics due to the high-dimensional nature of the data, which includes vast gene expression profiles across various spatial locations. Techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) are particularly valuable. PCA helps to reduce noise and highlight the most significant variance in the data, making it simpler to uncover underlying patterns and correlations. UMAP, ofen calculated from principal components (and not directly from features) preserves both global and local data structures, enabling more nuanced visualisations of complex cellular landscapes. Together, these methods facilitate a deeper understanding of spatial gene expression, helping to reveal biological insights such as cellular heterogeneity and tissue structure, which are crucial for both basic biological research and clinical applications.

#### Variable gene identification
genes <- !grepl(pattern = "^Rp[l|s]|Mt", x = rownames(spatial_data))
dec <- scran::modelGeneVar(spatial_data, subset.row = genes) 

# Visualisation
plot(dec$mean, dec$total, xlab = "Mean log-expression", ylab = "Variance")
curve(metadata(dec)$trend(x), col = "blue", add = TRUE)

# Get top variable genes 
dec <- scran::modelGeneVar(spatial_data, subset.row = genes, block = spatial_data$sample_id) 
hvg <- scran::getTopHVGs(dec, n = 1000)

rowData(spatial_data[head(hvg),])[,c("gene_id", "gene_name")]

# here the metadata for the genes
rowData(spatial_data)

#### PCA
# With the highly variable genes, we perform PCA to reduce dimensionality, followed by UMAP to visualise the data in a lower-dimensional space, enhancing our ability to observe clustering and patterns in the data.

spatial_data <- 
  spatial_data |> 
  scuttle::logNormCounts() |> 
  scater::runPCA(subset_row = hvg)

## Check correctness - names
reducedDimNames(spatial_data)

reducedDim(spatial_data, "PCA")[1:5, 1:5]

# As for single-cell data, we need to verify that there is not significant batch effect. If so we need to adjust for it (a.k.a. integration) before calculating principal component. Many adjustment methods to output adjusted principal components directly. 

#### UMAP
# You can appreciate that, in this case, selecting within-sample variable genes, we do not see major batch effects across samples. We see two major pixel clusters.
# We can appreciate that there are no major batch effects across samples, and we don't see grouping driven by sample_id.

set.seed(42)
spatial_data <- scater::runUMAP(spatial_data, dimred = "PCA")

scater::plotUMAP(spatial_data, colour_by = "sample_id", point_size = 0.2) 

# **Exercise 1.1** --------------------------------------------------------
# Visualise where the two macro clusters are located spatially. We will take a very pragmatic approach and get cluster label from splitting the UMAP coordinated in two (`colData()` and `reducedDim()` will help us, see above), and then visualise it with `ggspavis`.

# - Modify the `SpatialExperiment` object based on the UMAP1 dimension so to divide those 2 cluster
# - Visualise the UMAP colouring by the new labelling
# - Visualise the Visium slide colouring by the new labelling

UMAP_coord <- reducedDim(spatial_data,type = "UMAP") %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  mutate(manual_cluster = case_when(UMAP1>2~"clu_01",
                                    T~"clu_02"))


# add the metadata to the objetc

scater::plotUMAP(spatial_data, colour_by = "manual_cluster", point_size = 0.2) 

plotVisium(spatial_data,annotate = "manual_cluster")

### 7. Clustering
# Clustering in spatial transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the intricate cellular composition of tissues. This technique groups cells/pixels based on similar gene expression profiles, enabling the identification of distinct cell types and states within a tissue's spatial context. Clustering reveals patterns of cellular organisation and differentiation, and interactions in the microenvironment.

#### Transcriptome based nearest neighbours
# First, we establish the number of nearest neighbors to use in the k-NN graph. This graph forms the basis for clustering, using the Walktrap algorithm to detect community structures that suggest natural groupings or clusters in the data. `buildSNNGraph` is from the `scan` package.

## Set number of Nearest-Neighbours (NNs)
k <- 10

## Build the k-NN graph
g_walk <- 
  spatial_data |> 
  scran::buildSNNGraph( 
    k = 10, 
    use.dimred = "PCA"
  ) |> 
  igraph::cluster_walktrap()

clus <- g_walk$membership
## Check how many
table(clus)

# Applying Clustering Labels and Visualising Results: After determining clusters, we apply these labels back to the spatial data and visualise the results using UMAP. This allows us to observe how the data clusters in a reduced dimension space, and further visualise how these clusters map onto the physical tissue sections for context.

# We can appreciate here that we get two main pixel clusters.

colLabels(spatial_data) <- factor(clus)

scater::plotUMAP(spatial_data, colour_by = "label") + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")

# Those two clusters group the white matter from the rest of the layers.

## Plot in tissue map
ggspavis::plotSpots(spatial_data, annotate = "label") + 
  facet_wrap(~sample_id) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")

# As for comparison, we show the manually annotated regions. We can see that while the single cell style clustering catchers, the overall tissue, architecture, a lot of details are not retrieved. We clusters cannot faithfully recapitulate the tissue morphology. However, they might represent specific cell types within morphological regions.

## Plot ground truth in tissue map
ggspavis::plotSpots(spatial_data, annotate = "spatialLIBD") +
  facet_wrap(~sample_id) +
  scale_color_manual(values = libd_layer_colors)

#### Spatially-aware clustering
# To cluster spatial regions (i.e. tissue domain) rather than single-cell types, the clustering algorithms need to take spatial context into account. For example what is the transcriptional profile of the neighbouring pixels or neighbouring cells.

# BANKSY combines molecular and spatial information. BANKSY leverages the fact that a cell's state can be more fully represented by considering both its own transcriptome "nd that of its local microenvironment.This algorithm embeds cells within a combined space that incorporates their own transcriptome and that of their locell'svironment, representing both the cell state and the surrounding microenvironment.

# Overview of the algorithm 

# - \* Construct a neighborhood graph between cells in physical space (k-nearest neighbors or radius nearest neighbors). 
# - \* We use neighborhood graph to compute two matrices: 
# -- \*\* Average neighborhood expression matrix 
# -- \*\* "Azimuthal Gabor filter" matrix. It represents the transcriptomic microenvironment around each cell. It measures the gradient of gene expression in each cell's neighborhood. 
# 
# - \* These matrices are then scaled on the basis of a mixing parameter Î», which controls their relative weighting 
# - \* Concatenate these two matrices with the original geneâ€“cell expression matrix 
# - \* Combine these three matrices by direct product

# -   identify the pixel that have been smoothed, and

### 8. Deconvolution of pixel-based spatial data
# One of the popular algorithms for spatial deconvolution is SPOTlight. [Elosua-Bayes et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/9/e50/6129341).

# [Source](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SPOTlight/inst/doc/SPOTlight_kidney.html)
# 
# SPOTlight uses a seeded non-negative matrix factorization regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes and non-negative least squares.

#### Producing the reference for single-cell databases
# Here, we retrieve and prepare a single-cell RNA reference. The dataset in question, zhong-prefrontal-2018, originates from a study by Zhong et al. (2018), which offers a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic survey of the human prefrontal cortex during development . Utilising the scRNAseq package, the dataset is fetched and subsequently processed to aggregate counts across cells sharing the same sample and cell type, thereby reducing data complexity and enhancing interpretability. Further filtering steps ensure the removal of empty columns and entries with missing cell type annotations. Finally, the logNormCounts function from the scuttle package is applied to perform log-normalisation, a crucial step for mitigating technical variability and preparing the data for accurate comparative analyses .

# Get reference
library(scRNAseq)
brain_reference <- fetchDataset("zhong-prefrontal-2018", "2023-12-22")

brain_reference <- 
  brain_reference |> 
  scuttle::aggregateAcrossCells(ids = paste(brain_reference$sample, brain_reference$cell_types, sep = "_")) 

brain_reference <- brain_reference[, brain_reference |> assay() |> colSums() > 0]
brain_reference <- brain_reference[, !brain_reference$cell_types |> is.na()]

brain_reference <- 
  brain_reference |> 
  logNormCounts()

head(colData(brain_reference))

# These are the cell types included in our reference, and the number of pseudobulk samples we have for each cell type.
table(brain_reference$cell_types)

# These are the number of samples we have for each of the three data sets.
table(brain_reference$sample)

# Now, we identify the variable genes within each dataset, to not capture technical effects, and identify the union of variable genes for further analysis.
genes <- !grepl(pattern = "^Rp[l|s]|Mt", x = rownames(brain_reference))

# Convert to list
brain_reference_list <- lapply(unique(brain_reference$dataset_id), function(x) brain_reference[, brain_reference$dataset_id == x])

dec = scran::modelGeneVar(brain_reference, subset.row = genes, block = brain_reference$sample_id)
hvg_CAQ = scran::getTopHVGs(dec, n = 1000)

hvg_CAQ = unique( unlist(hvg_CAQ))

# Initially, the code prepares the spatial data by setting gene names as row identifiers.
spatial_data_gene_name <- spatial_data
rownames(spatial_data_gene_name) <- rowData(spatial_data_gene_name)$gene_name
spatial_data_gene_name = logNormCounts(spatial_data_gene_name)

# We then identify and score relevant marker genes based on their expression and significance across different cell types. The result is a curated list of high-potential marker genes, organised and ready for deeper analysis and interpretation in the context of spatial gene expression patterns.

# This function provides a convenience wrapper for marker gene identification between groups of cells, based on running `pairwiseTTests.` 

# This function represents a simpler and more intuitive summary of the differences between the groups. We do this by realizing that the p-values for these types of comparisons are largely meaningless; individual cells are not meaningful units of experimental replication, while the groups themselves are defined from the data. Thus, by discarding the p-values, we can simplify our marker selection by focusing only on the effect sizes between groups.

mgs <- scran::scoreMarkers(
  brain_reference, 
  groups = brain_reference$cell_types,
  
  # Omit mitochondrial genes and keep all the genes in spatial
  subset.row = 
    grep("(^MT-)|(^mt-)|(\\.)|(-)", rownames(brain_reference), value=TRUE, invert=TRUE) |> 
    intersect(rownames(spatial_data_gene_name))
)

# Select the most informative markers
mgs_df <- lapply(names(mgs), function(i) {
  x <- mgs[[i]]
  
  # Filter and keep relevant marker genes, those with AUC > 0.8
  x <- x[x$mean.AUC > 0.8, ]
  
  # Sort the genes from highest to lowest weight
  x <- x[order(x$mean.AUC, decreasing = TRUE), ]
  
  # Add gene and cluster id to the dataframe

# We now utilise `SPOTlight` to deconvolve tisslet'smposition from our independent mouse brain reference. The result is visualised through a scatter pie plot, which provides a graphical representation of the spatial distribution of cell types within a let'sfic sample. This visualisation aids in understanding the spatial heterogeneity.

# No, let's look at the correlation matrices to see which cell type are most often occurring rather than mutually exclusive within our data set.
plotCorrelationMatrix(res$mat)
mat_df = as.data.frame(res$mat)

# **Exercise 1.4** --------------------------------------------------------
# Rather than looking at the correlation matrix, overall, let's observe whether the correlation structure amongst cell types is consistent across samples. Do you think it's consistent or noticeably different?

# **Exercise 1.5** --------------------------------------------------------
## Exercise 1.5 (adapted to your current cell types)

# Some of the most positive correlations in the new matrix are seen between:

# - **Microglia** and **Neurons**  
# - **Astrocytes** and **Stem.cells**
# 
# > **Microglia** are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, constantly surveying the parenchyma and clearing debris.  
# > **Neurons** are the electrically excitable cells that transmit and process information via synaptic connections.  
# > **Astrocytes** are star-shaped glia that support neuronal metabolism, regulate extracellular ions and neurotransmitter uptake.  
# > **Stem.cells** denote undifferentiated progenitors capable of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple neural lineages.
# 
# Let us now **visualise** where these pairs of cell types most co-occur in your spatial map. For **each** pair, carry out the following:
# 
# 1. **Label** any pixel where both cell types exceed 10 % abundance (i.e. > 0.1).  
# 2. **Label** any pixel where the _sum_ of their abundances exceeds 40 % (i.e. > 0.4).  
# 3. **Plot** the spatial coordinates of all pixels, **colouring** them by this new label (for example:  
#    - `0` = neither condition met  
#    - `1` = both abundances > 0.1  
#    - `2` = summed abundance > 0.4  
# 
# You should end up with two analogous visualisations:
# 
# - **Microglia + Neurons**  
# - **Astrocytes + Stem.cells**
# 
# Feel free to reuse your previous code, simply substituting the cell-type columns and updating the thresholds as above.
